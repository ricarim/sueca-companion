## Overview

Sueca is a popular card game in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries. Often during the game, it's necessary to determine which cards have been played by each player. This application aims to facilitate this process through automatic detection of played cards.

## Features

 - **Card Detection:** Using a trained computer vision model, the application is capable of identifying and recognizing the cards present in an image.

 - **Game Assistance:** Once the cards are detected, the application provides useful information during the game, such as the suit and value of the cards.

## Project Status

 - Create Dataset :white_check_mark:
 - Train Dataset :white_check_mark:
 - Create android app (ongoing) 

### Planned Features

Some features that I would like to add in the future include:

 - Tutorial page
 - Support for different languages.
 - Improvements in the accuracy and speed of the card detection model.
 - Implementation of a training mode to enhance card detection.
